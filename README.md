# 👋 Hi, I'm Christophe

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a software engineer with over 20 years of experience building robust, cloud-native systems using .NET and Azure. I’ve had the privilege of scaling energy platforms for hundreds of thousands of devices, architecting distributed solutions, and leading development teams through transformative journeys.

And when I’m not solving complex problems at work, I’m deep in side projects—experimenting with game emulator integrations, building iOS apps, or authoring developer tools (like my [Mediator plugin for Rider/ReSharper](https://github.com/kzryzstof/mediatr-plugin)).

My passions? Clean architecture, effective scaling, and always learning something new.
